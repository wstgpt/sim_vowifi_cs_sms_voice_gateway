## Retained upstream notice: pagecat/vowifi_gateway (MIT)

MDD Sim Gateway is a derivative work of
[pagecat/vowifi_gateway](https://github.com/pagecat/vowifi_gateway), which contributes the VoWiFi
engine and the overall control-plane, engine and WebUI architecture. MDD Sim Gateway adds 4G
cellular data and SMS, per-country network egress routing, unified device management and automatic
provisioning, failover and a test suite. The combined work is distributed under GPL-3.0-only as
permitted by the MIT license; the original copyright and permission notice is retained below as
the MIT license requires:

## Files that are not GPL-3.0-only

MDD Sim Gateway defaults to GPL-3.0-only, but two sets of files are derivative works of
upstream projects and keep the upstream license instead. A derivative of GPL-2.0-only code
cannot be relicensed to GPL-3.0, so these are tracked explicitly:

| Path | License | Derived from |
|---|---|---|
| `engine/patches/asterisk/mt_rpack_routing.py` | GPL-2.0-only | Asterisk `send_rpack()` (GPL-2.0-only) |
| `patches/ccid/*.patch` | LGPL-2.1-or-later | LudovicRousseau/CCID (LGPL-2.1-or-later) |

Both patch the upstream source at build time. The patched Asterisk runs as a separate
process inside the engine container and communicates with the GPL-3.0-only control plane
over AMI and HTTP only; the patched CCID driver is loaded by pcscd as a separate component.
No GPL-3.0-only code is linked into either. Redistributing a built image or host install
means also offering the corresponding modified Asterisk and CCID sources under their own
licenses.

The engine image builds sysmocom's pjproject (GPL-2.0) from a pinned commit and links it into
that same Asterisk binary, so the Asterisk obligation above covers pjproject as well: shipping a
built engine image means also offering the corresponding pjproject source. Nothing in this
repository is derived from pjproject; it is fetched and compiled unmodified at build time.

The virtual PC/SC driver that backs a cellular modem's SIM slots (`libifdvpcd.so` from
frankmorgner/vsmartcard, GPL-3.0) is installed from the distribution's `vsmartcard-vpcd` package
by `install.sh` and loaded by pcscd as a separate component. `host/vpcd_modem_bridge.py` is
original GPL-3.0-only code that speaks the VPCD wire protocol to it; no vsmartcard code is copied
into this repository.

MDD does not copy sing-box or lpac binaries into this source repository. The installer fetches pinned upstream releases/source and verifies published or reviewed SHA-256 values where a binary is downloaded. Full license texts and copyright notices are included in those upstream distributions.
