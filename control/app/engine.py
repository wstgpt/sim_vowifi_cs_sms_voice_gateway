"""
engine.py - Per-SIM engine container lifecycle via the Docker SDK.

Each instance runs one `mdd-sim-gateway/engine` container that owns its ePDG tunnel + Asterisk.
The manager renders instance.json, starts/stops/recreates the container with the right
mounts/caps/ports, and reads the engine's runtime status files (bind-mounted run dir):
the swu_ike daemon publishes swu_status.json {state: CONNECTED} for tunnel state.

PC/SC: engine containers are pcscd CLIENTS — they mount the HOST pcscd socket (/run/pcscd).
The pcsc-lite client library in the engine image is pinned to the SAME version as the host
pcscd (Dockerfile PCSC_VERSION == install.sh PCSC_VERSION) so client/server protocol matches.
