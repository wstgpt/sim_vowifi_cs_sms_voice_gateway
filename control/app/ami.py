ami.py - Async Asterisk AMI client (per engine instance).

The manager keeps one AmiClient per running instance to: read IMS registration state,
send SMS (AMI MessageSend to the volte_ims endpoint), place calls (Originate), and
receive live events. Incoming call/SMS are primarily delivered via the engine's
notify.py HTTP hooks; AMI events supplement call state.
