"""
usbreader.py - Map live PC/SC reader indices to their STABLE physical USB port path.

Why this exists
---------------
The rig can hold two *identical* smart-card readers (e.g. Alcor/AK9563 2ce3:9563) that carry
**no USB serial number**. pcscd/libccid can only tell such readers apart by USB *enumeration
order*, which races at boot / pcscd restart / power-up timing. So the reader NAME suffix
("00 00" / "01 00") and therefore the smartcard.System.readers() index are NOT stable — they can
flip between two physically-untouched readers. A line bound to "reader index 1" then silently
authenticates against the wrong (or an empty) reader -> the engine reads no card -> swu_ike falls
back to DEFAULT RES/CK/IK -> the carrier rejects EAP-AKA.

The fix is to bind a line to the reader's physical USB **port path** (e.g. "3-2" = bus 3, port 2),
which only changes if the reader is physically moved to another socket. This module resolves the
current index<->port mapping so callers can (a) capture a line's port at provision time and
(b) re-resolve the live index for that port at every start.

How the mapping is derived (verified on the Pi, host AND inside the engine container):
    live index --SCARD_ATTR_CHANNEL_ID--> (bus, devnum) --/sys/bus/usb/devices/*/{busnum,devnum}--> port
      idx0  CHANNEL_ID 05012000  bus1 dev5  -> "1-2"
      idx1  CHANNEL_ID 02032000  bus3 dev2  -> "3-2"
CHANNEL_ID for a USB reader is a little-endian u32 = 0x00200000 | (bus<<8) | devnum. The devnum
changes on re-enumeration, but it is only used transiently here to map an already-open handle back
to its sysfs node; the resulting port path (the sysfs dir basename) is the stable identity we keep.

Everything is best-effort: any reader that can't be resolved (no CHANNEL_ID, sysfs unavailable) is
simply omitted, so callers fall back to their existing index/ICCID logic and are never worse off.
