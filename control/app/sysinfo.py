"""Host health for an appliance that is usually a single-board computer.

A VoWiFi line depends on the box it runs on far more than on anything this project
configures: on a Raspberry Pi 3 the Ethernet NIC hangs off the same USB 2.0 bus (and the same
power rail) as the cellular module and the card reader, so a brown-out takes out the network,
the modem and the SIM at the same instant. That failure reaches the status machine as a tunnel
that stopped passing traffic, which is indistinguishable from a bad carrier or a bad exit node
unless the host's own state is recorded next to it.

Everything here is read-only, cheap (procfs/sysfs plus one optional vcgencmd call) and
degrades silently: fields that a platform cannot answer are omitted rather than faked, so a
non-Pi host simply reports fewer of them.
