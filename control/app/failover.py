"""Decide whether a line's failure is evidence against its exit node, and when to stop trying.

A line that cannot register used to be treated as proof that its exit was unusable, and every
such failure moved the exit. Measured over fifty freezes on a live gateway that inference was
wrong more often than right: the node blamed most often was chosen again nine times and then
carried the same line for eight uninterrupted hours. Registration fails for carrier-side and
IMS-side reasons too, and each exit change tears down a working tunnel — which produces the
next failure, which moves the exit again. Countries with one candidate never churned; the one
with eleven walked its whole pool in forty minutes. That is the loop this module ends.

Two decisions, deliberately separate:

  classify()  attributes a single failure — is the exit implicated at all?
  record()    folds attributed failures into a per-line ledger and says what to do next.

The five outcomes are not symmetric, because the cost of continuing differs:

  HOLD      keep rebuilding on the same exit; nothing is proven yet
  SWITCH    this node has had its chances and others remain untried
  BACK_OFF  every exit failed the same way — which is what a host-side outage or a dead
            subscription looks like, not what bad nodes look like. Announce once, then
            retry on a slow cadence: upstream faults pass, and a line that stops forever
            over a transient outage trades one failure for a worse one
  GIVE_UP   stop rebuilding and report — the operator pinned this exit and it has had its
            chances, so the only useful moves left belong to a person
  REPORT    report but keep rebuilding — the exits are fine and the fault is upstream, where
            retrying costs nothing and the carrier may simply come back

Stopping the churn matters as much as switching. The previous policy could not stop: once
every candidate was cooling down it cleared the cooldown and started the pool over, forever,
and a locked exit rebuilt its container every few minutes for as long as it kept failing.

One more veto, because a line's exit is shared by every line of its country: when a sibling
line is registered over the same exit right now, the exit is demonstrably carrying IMS and
moving it would tear down that sibling's tunnel — the disruption this design exists to avoid.
Eviction is off the table while the peer holds. A tunnel that will not establish over an exit
that provably works is most likely the carrier refusing this SIM's traffic from that address,
which is a person's call to make, so the failure is recorded and in time reported.
