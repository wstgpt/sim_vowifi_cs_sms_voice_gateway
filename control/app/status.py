status.py - Per-instance status state machine with failure classification.

Returns a live snapshot: {state, label, reason_code, reason, detail}. The manager's
health tracker (main.py) overlays retry counters and, on exhaustion, an ERROR state.

States:      STOPPED, NO_CARD, PIN_PROBLEM, EPDG_UNRESOLVED, TUNNEL_DOWN, REGISTERING, OK
reason_code: machine key for the WebUI; `reason` is a user-friendly sentence.
detail:      raw signals (pin, pcscf, registration, ike classification) for advanced view.
